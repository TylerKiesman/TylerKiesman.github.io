  	      <p>I've always been passionate about personal
            growth and development and I'm always looking for ways to improve. I'm
            interested in self-improvement and a firm believer that anyone
            can change their life through knowledge and focusing on themselves.
            I'm dedicated to school and learning and embark on personal projects
            to deepen my understanding of software development.
            Through my classes at school and self-driven learning I strive
            to improve my skills and advance my knowledge.

		<h6><i>January 2020 - Present</i></h6>
		<p>
		  <font size=3>
			Currently working with the IT communications team to develop a Microsoft Teams bot that will take 
			information from chats and display them around different Cisco Webex Boards around the offices of the company.
			The backend of it all is being written in NodeJS and uses Amazon Web Services to help with storage and hosting the bot.
			I was also responsible for developing an object detection model to be used to detect different bottles and determine 
			the amount of liquid in them.

		<h6><i>August 2019 - December 2019</i></h6>
		<p>
		  <font size=3>
        Developed a system for centralizing data from multiple programs and services that the company had developed. 
        I worked to format all the data into a single JSON format, made it flow through a tool called NiFi, and stored it into a 
        Solr database where it could be viewed and filtered using a platform called Banana. I also worked to replicate the same system 
        this time using one piece of technology called Fluentd.

		<p>
		  <font size=3>
		    Worked on multiple assignments under the team responsible for the Service Line Analytics product. The first being a SQL script
			which would generate a report for the business analysts on the team to see what information was stored in one of their databases and what information
			was missing. The next was a Java program which would extract information from an Excel workbook and would generate a .csv file and a corresponding database migration
			which would insert the generated information into a database. Before, all the information had been put in by hand but this program turned what would take hours
			into a process that would take seconds. Lastly, I developed a generic algorithm for detecting duplications found in files that the team was receiving
			from entities sending them data. This algorithm was then implemented into their pipeline for receiving files.

            better feel for how JavaScript interacts with a webpage and to get
            used to the syntax of jQuery. When a user guesses a
            number the webpage responds by giving hints to the user until they
            guess the correct number. A link to this game can be

	  the goal was to develop an application using their machine learning framework Pytorch. I developed a 
	  basic Android application where a user could upload pictures of the clothing in their wardrobe and the 
	  application would build a stylish outfit based on color, clothing trends, and the weather. I developed a 
	  Faster RCNN Object Detection model in Pytorch and used that along with a K-Means clustering algorithm to 
	  help determine clothing types and the color of the clothes. These would then be combined to build an 
	  algorithm that could build stylish outfits that were weather appropriate.
