        I was responsible for designing and prototyping a new UI to replace the current display for a content management system. 
		I developed a bubble navigation system that displayed content property information and used nodes to convey the associations 
		between different pieces of content in the system. I also researched ways to transform some of the information which was previously 
		being displayed in tables into charts and maps. Some examples included using box plots, choropleth maps, and chord diagrams to display 
		this data. All of this was done using React and utilized the libraries D3.js and Rete.js for page manipulation and node creation.

			I worked with IT communications and my engineering team to develop a Microsoft Teams bot that would take information
			from chats and display them on Cisco Webex boards that were located around the offices of the company. The back end was 
			a Node.js server and used Amazon Web Services to help with storage, routing, and hosting the bot. I was also responsible 
			for developing a computer vision model that would detect different bottles and determine the amount of liquid in them.

        Developed a system for centralizing data from multiple programs and services that the company had developed. 
        I worked to format all the data into a single JSON format, made it flow through a tool called NiFi, and stored it into a 
        Solr database where it could be viewed and filtered using a platform called Banana. I also worked to replicate the same system 
        this time using one piece of technology called Fluentd.

		  <font size=3>
		    Worked on multiple assignments under the team responsible for the Service Line Analytics product. The first being a SQL script
			which would generate a report for the business analysts on the team to see what information was stored in one of their databases and what information
			was missing. The next was a Java program which would extract information from an Excel workbook and would generate a .csv file and a corresponding database migration
			which would insert the generated information into a database. Before, all the information had been put in by hand but this program turned what would take hours
			into a process that would take seconds. Lastly, I developed a generic algorithm for detecting duplications found in files that the team was receiving
			from entities sending them data. This algorithm was then implemented into their pipeline for receiving files.

			Society to develop a business intelligence dashboard. The dashboard collected data from a variety
			of resource streams and consolidated them into an easy-to-navigate web app. This required my team
			to develop a project plan which defined our process methodology, goals and scope, deliverables, 
			risk management, scheduling, and metrics. We followed a Scrum approach, having two-week sprints, 
			creating user stories, estimating tasks, calculating our velocity, and conducting retrospectives. 
			We worked to gather requirements and develop an MVP for the zoo. The project was made with NodeJS 
			and had a React frontend along with an Express backend to serve API calls.</font></td>

            this small exercise introduced me to JavaScript and

            better feel for how JavaScript interacts with a webpage and to get
            used to the syntax of jQuery. When a user guesses a
            number the webpage responds by giving hints to the user until they
            guess the correct number. A link to this game can be

			Faster RCNN Object Detection model in Pytorch and used that along with a K-Means clustering algorithm to 
			help determine clothing types and the color of the clothes. These would then be combined to build an 
			algorithm that could build stylish outfits that were weather appropriate.
